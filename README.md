Full And Complete Enrolement (FACE) https://www.nptcgroup.ac.uk/

I built a website for NPTC to enable their students to enrole for a degree or A-Level with Neath Port Talbot College at Dwr-y-Felin Road, Neath, Neath Port Talbot, SA10 7RF, United Kingdom.

This was a four week contract with Reed Global to build the eight page website in C#, ASP.Net, ADO.Net, HTML5, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, BootStrap JavaScript, Microsoft SQL Server.

I used Application State Persistance to move the unique key from one page to the other, ADO.Net to read the database and populate the fields on page load, and insert data into the database to save it. 

I was a bedroom programmer for this role, I had a Scrum meeting every Friday with the IT Manager, then went home and did the weekly sprint.
